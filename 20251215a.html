        <h1>The exams... are coming</h1>
            <p>So I started doing &laquo;end-of-term&raquo; exams today. You guys should know what does &laquo;end-of-term&raquo; mean here if you have read my post about <a href="20250905a.html">Vietnamese educational system</a>.</p>
            <p>The exam today was... haha, actually it was a group project and I didn't do anything. Worry not though, since it doesn't really matter, everyone has marks!</p>
            <p>The problem will start tomorrow. I will have to study for most of the next exams...</p>
