        <h1>Random stuffs 5th</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>This is the fifth <i>Random stuffs</i> post, which belongs to December 2025. This is also the last one of the year.</p>
            <p>Well, I haven't really prepared for anything, haha...</p>
            <p>Regardless, let'see what I have gone through and other stuff in 2025!</p>
            <h2>What I have gone through</h2>
                <p>So, in earlier this year, I've got to play some games on Google Doodles like Magic Cat Academy, Champion Island games, etc. Also, I've also played Deltarune and Undertale (yup, I played Deltarune before Undertale — I've just bought Undertale recently, in fact). And of course the list includes OneShot, though I've only watched walkthroughs.</p>
                <p>I've also chosen my political ideology: Democratic Socialism.</p>
                <p>And how can I forget about my achievements in programming (and related things)? I have published my first Python modules this year, you can check them out on PyPI! My favourite one is countries-dictionary by the way.</p>
                <p>Also, I've been working on my website and being more active on GitHub, you see?</p>
                <p>More about my personal life, I've also been making many friends at school, especially that one specific guy. He's into programming too, but he is much more better than me, being able to use many programming languages, unlike me who only uses Python (and seldom JavaScript). Also, how do I say this, he's kind of... insane. Like, can you imagine a person who always tells you about their crazy projects and ideas, like a browser that allows you to search... r34 stuff, and bringing some kind of device to sabotage the school's drone (by the way, I DID see his r34 browser). To be fair though, I'd say that I'm that crazy, too, and he has bloody chosen the right person to talk with. He has a GitHub account, which is Mytai20100.</p>
                <p>There must be many more things I have gone through, but heh, I don't have time to tell them all.</p>
            <h2>Other stuffs</h2>
                <p>So, politically, we have the Nepali Gen Z protests, the assassination of Charlie Kirk, etc.</p>
                <p>On the Internet, we have the brainrot stuffs, 67 jokes, etc.</p>
                <p>By the way, how would you think if I said that the Vietnamese Internet almost always has the Vietnamese alternate memes of some popular memes on the global one? So, there was a meme about KSI's song &laquo;Thick of it&raquo; and it was criticised heavily. Meanwhile, there is also a Vietnamese equivalent called &laquo;Pickleball&raquo;, widely known as &laquo;Anh hẹn em Pickleball&raquo;. And the 67 jokes, Vietnamese also have a joke number which is 36. It's kind of used as a N-word for people who are from Thanh Hóa. Well, interesting, eh?</p>
                <p>And of course we have to mention the Epstein files. Man, I can't believe ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ did ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛ to ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛.</p>
                <p>That's the end for the last <i>Random stuffs</i> post of 2025. Happy new year everyone!</p>
