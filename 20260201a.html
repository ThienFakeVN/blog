        <h1>Random stuffs 6th</h1>
            <p>Xin chào / Hello / Здравствуйте!</p>
            <p>Welcome to the sixth <i>Random stuffs</i> post which belongs to January 2025! Well, it seems that I'm going to have a lot of stuffs to tell this time. It just has been the first of February, haha...</p>
            <p>January 2025 is the first month that has absolutely no post by the way.</p>
            <h2>Capture of Nicolás Maduro</h2>
                <p>&laquo;On 3 January 2026, the United States launched a military strike in Venezuela and captured incumbent Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores&raquo; (acordding to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title&oldid=1335832697">Wikipedia (oldid=1335832697)</a>).</p>
                <p>Well, America has invaded another country again after 23 years (the invasion of Iraq). And all for what? OIL again (and more but I don't really care). Ironically, &laquo;Trump and his administration made clear that access to Venezuelan oil was a core reason for the action&raquo; (still acordding to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title&oldid=1335832697">Wikipedia (oldid=1335832697)</a>), they finally admitted it.</p>
                <p>On the other hand though, that means democracy comes to Venezuelans, right? Well, I'd not say they are really free, but rather, &laquo;under new management&raquo;, literally. The current acting president of Venezuela Delcy Rodríguez is a member of PSUV, the same party of which Maduro is also a member, and the same government that was led by Maduro is still there.</p>
                <p>Regardless, I pray for anyone who lost their lives in the crisis, especially the 32 Cuban military and security personnel.</p>
                <p>By the way, is that me or the current photo of Rodríguez on Wikipedia (oldid=1335807606) makes her younger and more beautiful than the previous one (oldid=1335491928)? Just saying what in my mind though :P</p>
            <h2>Nipah Virus</h2>
                <p>Recently, there's a virus called &laquo;Nipah Virus&raquo; and it's causing a small outbreak in India. Only 2 (or some more) people has been confirmed to be infected so far though.</p>
                <p>Acordding to what I know, this virus originated in South East Asia. And where's my country Vietnam located? South East Asia. You can get infected from infected bats or pigs. Its systoms are also terrible, ranging from fevers, headaches to even seizures and comas. The fatality rate is also concerning. While it depends on the outbreak, the highest one ever recorded was 73%.</p>
                <p>Despite that however, last time I played Plague Inc, the Nipah Virus in the eponymous scenario has low infectivity so we needn't worry. Though, keep in mind that we had SARS‑CoV‑2 which spreads quickly but has a low fatality rate (1%) and it still caused a global crisis. If there were a mutation of Nipah Virus that has higher spread, well, we would be doomed.</p>
                <p>Heh, we are truly lucky that many deadly diseases don't spread very quickly...</p>
                <p>Well, let's move on with a topic that is not really bad but still very annoying, it is...</p>
            <h2>How long does it take until Lunar New Year</h2>
                <p>2026.02.17, that's the date, just calculate itself.</p>
                <p>I still have like several tests at school before it 🥀.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I am going to talk about stuffs that relate to me.</p>
            <h2>My exam results</h2>
                <p>So, the first term of this school year has ended. So, what was my final grade?</p>
                <p>Well, I was a &laquo;EXCELLENT STUDENT&raquo;, yeah!</p>
                <p>In case you forget the academic achievements in Vietnamese schools, check <a href="20250831a.html">the first <i>Random stuffs</i> post</a>.</p>
                <p>Ok, let's move on.</p>
            <h2>Converting my sites to Markdown</h2>
                <p>I'm not very good at building with HTML, and recently, I just have discovered that I can use Markdown. I've converted <a href="https://thienfakevn.github.io">the main page of this website</a> into Markdown already.</p>
                <p>Well, this, is still annoying though =(</p>
                <p>There are going to be many stuffs to do this month.</p>
